        <p>Hi! I'm Fernando, a developer. Coding is my passion and using it to bring ideas into life is what motivates me to keep learning. I started as a Software Engineer programming core functionalities for an ERP system. After delivering my first solution and seeing the satisfaction of the end user when his problem was solved, a spark of joy struck me. Soon, I was using my spare time to develop programs that could help our day-to-day tasks like budget control, to-do lists and more. That put me in contact with an array of different technologies and a whole new world full of possibilities. Today, I like searching for solutions in both front and back-end, with quite an interest for organized, simple and clean codes.</p>
